    What do I know about html? Not much but I'm learnin.
    
All of the code for this site is at my [github repository](http://github.com/philwilliammee/philwilliammee.github.com)

## To-Do

Hi my site is still heavily under construction as I try and figure out how I want it set up.
I have borrowed from [jekyll bootsrap](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap) to help me get started so you will see a lot of refernces to jekyll.

Read [Jekyll Quick Start](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html)

Complete usage and documentation available at: [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com)
