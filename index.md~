A [control system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system)manages and regulates other devices in the system. The above image is a typical set up, without feedback.There are many ways of controlling a system and there are many companies that would like to sell you their system and their software package. This blog will focus on open source hardware and software, and projects that have a good value for the cost of components.

All of my projects will use some sort of interface. In computer science, an [interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_%28computing%29),  is the point of interaction with software, or computer hardware, or with peripheral devices such as a computer monitor or a keyboard.  The interface I will use will usually be my laptop. Most input and output will be through my monitor and keyboard. 
My computer is  a simple dual core processor running the Debian operating system.

Python 2.7 will be the software running most of the control algorithms, and GUI.

This site was made with a RaspberryPi and the Raspbian OS
    
This site uses `ruby gems`, `jekyll`, `html` and is hosted by github.
On your raspberryPi you will have to get ruby and jekyll
    
    sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-full
    gem install jekyll.

mkdir your USERNAME.github.com folder in your home directory and not your root directory. I did it in root and had key issues.

check out my raspberrypi [project log](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=34300) at the raspberry pi forums. 

## To-Do
This site is still under construction, as I try and figure out how I want it set up.

All of the code for this site is at my [github repository](http://github.com/philwilliammee/philwilliammee.github.com)<br>
Complete usage and documentation available at: [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com)
