One of the first Jobs I had was in manufacturing. I worked on a simple machine that had a motor, valves, a LCD monitor, and a keypad. I was amazed at how the machine worked and how I could control the machine from a terminal. I wondered how the designers could use electronics to control mechanics? This Blog explores that question and related topics in theory and practical application.
